# Python Expense Tracker

## Overview
The **Python Expense Tracker** is a financial management application designed to help users efficiently manage their personal or business expenses. This project demonstrates the practicality and simplicity of Python as a modern programming language.

## Features
- **Add Expenses**: Record expenses with details such as amount, category, and description.
- **View Expense History**: Display a list of all recorded expenses.
- **Generate Summary Reports**: Provide a summary of expenses categorized by type.
- **Export Data**: Save expense records as a CSV file for external analysis.

## Project Highlights
### Why Python?
- **Readable Syntax**: Python's clean, natural language-like syntax ensures code simplicity.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Comprehensive libraries like `datetime`, `csv`, and `collections` enable quick implementation of features.
- **Versatility**: Supports multiple programming paradigms and is widely adopted in web development, data science, automation, and more.

### Implementation Details
- **Expense Management**: Utilizes a Python class to encapsulate functionalities.
- **Data Aggregation**: Employs `collections.defaultdict` for summarizing expenses.
- **File Handling**: Uses the `csv` module for exporting data.
- **Interactive Console Menu**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-expense-tracker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
